# TipCalculatorNew

 CodePath Tip Calculator Pre-Work 
 
 Took this challenge to create a Tip Calculator that was required for the application of the IOS class in CodePath. 
 
 The UI design was kept Simple to make user enjoy using the App. 
 
 Added the Split for groups that go eat and they want to know how much each one of them will pay after Tip. 
 
 The UI design Can definitly be better, but for now I think this is great and clean design that does the job.
